<h1 align="center">DIDE</h1>
<p align="center">DIDE is a Docs add-on that turns Docs into an IDE</p>

### Installation

Create a Google Apps script project and paste in the code!

I don't want to add it to the web store because It's not very polished, and lacks in general functionality.

### Features

- Preview HTML and run JS code.
- Instant Dark theme
- Won't intrude on your other Docs
- Allows exporting as a standalone file

With all that said it still lacks:

- Debugging
- Syntax Highlighting

### Supported File Types

It currently supports:

- JavaScript
- HTML
